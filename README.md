\#7languages7weeks Challenge
============================

This is a repository documenting my journey through the 
[#7languages7weeks](https://twitter.com/search/%237languages7weeks)
challenge.

Others joining in on the adventure can fork this repository. It contains the 
following branches:

* [master](http://github.com/mbbx6spp/7languages7weeks) - its purpose is to 
act as a scratchpad for the participant.
* [book](http://github.com/mbbx6spp/7languages7weeks/tree/book) - its purpose
is to provide quick access to the book code examples as you can download them 
from Pragmatic Programmers website.
* [gh-pages](http://github.com/mbbx6spp/7languages7weeks/tree/gh-pages) - its
purpose is to provide a home for a blog site that is based on 
[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) conventions such that GitHub will 
automatically generate the site upon pushing the branch to your GitHub 
repository. You will be able to see the generated blog site at 
http://{{user}}.github.com/7languages7weeks where {{user}} is your GitHub 
username.


Overview
--------

The code in this repository is based on the following book from 
Pragmatic Programmers:

* [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](http://www.amazon.com/Seven-Languages-Weeks-Programming-Programmers/dp/193435659X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&tag=supo-20&ie=UTF8&qid=1307764498&sr=1-1)

First I imported the source code of the book, which is available for download
on the Pragmatic Programmers website into the book branch.

The master branch, as mentioned above, will be used as a scratchpad area 
for the participant to work within.
